# Excersise 2: SES/DES/TES

This Java program contains a visualisation of the SES / DES / TES forecasting regressions on the 'SwordSales' time-series included in the 'Data Smart' textbook.

The forecasts almost perfectly match the forecasts that the textbook provides.

Run using:

`cd excersise-2/`
`mvn exec:java`
